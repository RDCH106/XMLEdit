# XMLEdit
A Tkinter GUI to edit XML files

This is a program for reading and editing XML files
Current attributes and tag contents can be edited; no new attributes or tags can be created.
This program was written specifically for wide char config files generated by MS .net
But should work with anything.
Type in a directory or browse to one using the "..." button.
A list of files matching the extensions in the options file will be made and populate the dropdown
Selecting a file will load it.
Save a file by pressing the "Save" button or "Ctrl-s"
The file is renamed with a current timestamp, and the new file is written in it's place.

The program will open a file given as a command line argument, which means you can associtate this program with .xml files to open them from the explorer right click menu.
